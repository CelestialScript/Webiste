### Sihan's Ideas:

My goal is to not use any english words in this language.
_____

`$("Hello, world!");`

`cr number% = 9` (cr stands for create)

All variables end in a '%'.

```
(number > 10)? {
  $(number%, "is greater than 10!");
}
```

### Adam's Ideas:
My idea is to make the language accept both python and js syntax.
For example some people like using {} others like to use Python's syntax which is just tabs.
Learn more here about the differences: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jld0aUQ9LZw
So both python's code and js's code will work.

Also make an package module that is light weight.
